<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

ThomaSIGHTS represents my most ambitious undertaking yet - developed as my capstone thesis project with the intent of creating an AI system to address major societal issues. The core objectives were twofold: leverage complex artificial intelligence techniques not commonly implemented, and provide impactful solutions that could drive positive change.

After extensive research of numerous problem spaces, my team chose to focus on the mixed-ability challenges faced in many preschool environments. The varying development levels and learning styles present in individual students can make effectively tailoring teaching methods difficult for instructors. ThomaSIGHTS aims to assist teachers in better understanding and connecting with this diverse range of young minds during their crucial developmental years.

The system combines computer vision algorithms like YOLO and Deepsort to unobtrusively monitor student engagement and reactions during lessons. This data feeds into classifiers leveraging Random Forest and Hybrid Filtering to categorize learning preferences and predict the composition of auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learners within a given classroom. Finally, ThomaSIGHTS provides targeted recommendations on instruction plans correlating to these breakouts so teachers can readily adapt their techniques to resonate across ability spectrums.

The core goal is an easy-to-use automated toolkit that eliminates pain points, allowing teachers to focus on what matters most - nurturing our future generations.
